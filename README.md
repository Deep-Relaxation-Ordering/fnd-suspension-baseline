# fnd-suspension-baseline

Numerical pilot: Brownian motion and gravitational sedimentation of diamond
particles in aqueous suspension as a function of particle size.

*Endorsement Marker: Local stewardship — U. Warring, AG Schätz, Physikalisches
Institut Freiburg. Pilot implementation, not a Coastline.*

## What this repo is

The implementation of the breakout note
[*Numerical Pilot: Brownian Motion and Sedimentation of Diamond Particles in
Aqueous Suspension as a Function of Particle Size* (v0.2)](https://github.com/Deep-Relaxation-Ordering/diamonds_in_water/blob/main/breakout-note-brownian-sedimentation.md).

The breakout note is the spec; this repo is the artefact. Read the spec first:
it states scope, methods (analytical / Langevin / Smoluchowski), validation
strategy, parameter scan, regime classification, deliverables, and
acknowledged limitations. Do not paraphrase the note here.

## What this repo is not

- Not an experimental data repository (no measurements live here).
- Not a phase-transition or ice-nucleation study (deferred to a separate breakout).
- Not a comparison against the Mpemba literature (deferred).

## Project rules (inherited)

This repo follows the project-wide rules in
[`threehouse-plus-ec/cd-rules`](https://github.com/threehouse-plus-ec/cd-rules)
(Corporate Design blueprint). The pinned version and per-rule applicability
table are recorded in [`docs/conventions.md`](docs/conventions.md).

Where this repo and `cd-rules` disagree, `cd-rules` is authoritative and this
repo is amended.

### Documented deviations from the standard cd-rules folder structure (§14)

| Rule (cd-rules §14) | Standard | This repo | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| `index.html` at root | Required for web-rendered specimen | Omitted | Numerical pilot — no web specimen layer is intended. README + lab notes are the authored surfaces. If a rendered specimen is needed later, it will be added under `docs/` rather than at root. |
| `assets/` with `LICENCE` + `SOURCE.md` | Required for repos consuming cd-rules visual assets | Omitted | This pilot does not consume cd-rules visual assets (emblem, tokens.css). The folder will be added under Model B (§0.10) only when assets are first needed. |
| `src/`, `tests/`, `notebooks/`, `lab_notes/` | Not in the cd-rules standard tree | Added | Required by the breakout-note spec §4.3 (the implementation surfaces of a numerical pilot). These extend, not replace, the cd-rules tree. |

## Status

Day 0 — repository scaffold only. No methods are implemented yet. The first
lab note is at [`lab_notes/2026-04-27-scaffold.md`](lab_notes/2026-04-27-scaffold.md).

The 12-day effort estimate and phase plan live in breakout-note §9.
